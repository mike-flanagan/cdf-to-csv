# Overview
The contents of this repository include an exploration of some sample CDF files with the goal to output CSV files of the mean precipitation data across all lat-long locations for the 30 years recorded from the sample models. 

# Data
Each CDF file represents its respective model's predicted mean precipitation data across the months of October-November-December-January for each year (from 1985-2014).
